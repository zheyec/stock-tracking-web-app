# Stock Tracking Web Application
This was one of the projects and assignments I did when I took CS50@Yale in July, 2018.

## Description
This project used **Python** to create a web application that provides a simulated environment for users to create accounts, login, view stocks, buy stocks, and sell stocks as if in real life.  

It used **Flask** as the basic web framework and **Jinja** for rendering HTML pages. It also used **MySQL** for storing and maintaining information like user data and stock prices.
